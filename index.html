            <h2>WHO AM I?</h2>
            <p>I'm a developer fueled by awe and inspired by the amazement of building and creating wonderous things.</p>
          </div>
          <p>After years as a mathematics educator, teaching students from middle-school through undergraduate college, I decided to make the switch to a more creative career as a software developer.  I attended Dev Bootcamp's Web Development Immersive program in late 2016, gaining experience working in Rails 5 to create dynamic web apps incorporating React, THREE.js, p5.js, JavaScript ES6, JQUERY, AJAX, CSS3, HTML5, and Materialize.  My passions lie in working to create apps involving art, music, media, graphics, and games.</p>
          <p>I am currently seeking employment in the greater New York City area as a full-time developer or engineer.  Please, don't hesitate to <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/contact">contact me</a> today!</p>

      <h2>WHAT AM I ABOUT?</h2>
      <p class="white-outline-text">I studied pure and applied mathematics, and secondary education, before making the switch the development and engineering.  It is my belief that my skills as a developer are firmly rooted in my mathematical and logical problem solving abilities.  I think of problem solving as uncovering a hidden set of steps from an issue, to a solution.  A developer may uncover many sets of stairs that lead to a solution, and many more that lead nowhere.  Finding the "best" solution depends on the situation, and it is my job to find the most appropriate staircase for each individual circumstance.
      <p class="white-outline-text">The majority of my experience is based in Rails 5, several modern JavaScript libraries, including React, THREE.js, p5.js, and JQUERY; with substantial HTML5, CSS3, and many CSS frameworks, such as Materialize and Jekyll.  Programming languages are all built on the same structures: variables, data structures, and algorithms.  The only barriers involve syntax and best practices; barriers that can easily be overcome with practice, documentation, and a healthy dose of Google searches.</p>
      <p class="white-outline-text">I have worked on projects involving social media, music, graphics, and public APIs.  I am always interested in working in new fields, languages, frameworks, and methodologies!</p>
